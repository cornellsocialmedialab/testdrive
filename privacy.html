                    Thank you for visiting Social Media TestDrive. Below you will find the privacy policy for Social Media TestDrive, a web application promoting digital literacy created by the Social Media Lab at Cornell University ("Social Media Lab," “we” or “us”), in
                    collaboration with Common Sense. We are dedicated to protecting user privacy and handling any personal information we obtain with care and respect. This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") is designed to answer your questions regarding
                    how we collect, protect, use and share information obtained through the Social Media TestDrive App available at app.socialmediatestdrive.org (collectively, the "Service”). We hope this information increases your confidence in the Social
                    Media Lab and Social Media TestDrive and enhances your experience using the Social Media TestDrive Service.
                </p>
                <p class="privacyParagraph">
                    Please also see our Terms of Use, which are available at <a href="https://socialmediatestdrive.org/terms.html" class="noDecorationText">https://socialmediatestdrive.org/terms.html</a>, which, together with this Policy, govern the use
                    of the Service. If you are a youth user, we encourage you to read this Policy and the applicable Terms of Use with your parent/guardian/teacher before using the Service and not to use the Service if you or your parent/guardian/teacher
                    disagrees with any part of this Policy or the Terms of Use. By using the Service, you signify agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy and the Terms of Use. Please note, however, that this Policy and the Terms of Use apply
                    solely to your use of the Service and do not govern your use of other websites or mobile applications produced or published by the Social Media Lab.

                    2. What Information is Collected?
                </h3>
                <p class="privacyParagraph">
                    In this Policy, <span class="boldText">Personal Information</span> means information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual online or offline, such as the individual's name, email address, phone number, or a
                    persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different sites or services. <span class="boldText">Non-Personal Information</span> is aggregated information, demographic information and other individual
                    information that does not reveal a person's identity.

                <p class="privacyParagraph">
                    The Service does not collect Personal Information. The Service is used anonymously. Users can enter any lesson module as a guest, which will automatically create a one-time-use user account. Once the user finishes a module or leaves the Service, the user
                    will be asked whether they are willing to share their clickstream, textual input and the end-of-module knowledge quiz results (activity log data generated as the user went through the module) to help our development team test, research,
                    and improve the TestDrive platform. The activity log data are anonymous and do NOT include any personal information that enables us to trace back to any individual user. All personal information (names, addresses, emails, school names
                    etc.), if any, that appeared in users’ textual input will be filtered and deleted before data analysis. If the user consents to share his/her activity log data with us, we will include his/her data in our database for further analysis
                    and research to better understand how users learn on the TestDrive platform in order to develop and improve our services. If the user declines to share his/her log data, the system will delete all activity logs associated with this
                    guest account. There is no way this guest account can be recovered or reused by users or by the Social Media Lab.
                </p>
                <p class="privacyParagraph">
                    The user activity log data on this site will be used strictly for improving user experience in the future and supporting academic research, and will NOT be disclosed to marketing companies or other third parties who are not directly involved in the provision
                    of this service. All data used for research purposes will be reported in ways that will NOT reveal any user's identity. Data will be stored in a safe hard drive of the Social Media Lab, in secure Cornell Box folders and Cornell’s Red
                    Cloud system, which will be only accessible by the research team of Social Media TestDrive. All user activity log data will be destroyed within six months after being collected.
                </p>
                <p class="privacyParagraph">
                    Users also have the option to provide feedback through an anonymous Qualtrics survey at the end of each module; this survey does not collect any Personal Information. You can access Qualtrics’ Privacy Policy at https://www.qualtrics.com/privacy-statement/.
                    This Policy does not address, nor do we accept responsibility for, the manner in which schools or other third parties collect, use, or share information derived from the Service.

                <p class="privacyParagraph">
                    We and our service providers may collect certain Non-Personal Information automatically when the Service is used, and such information may include anonymous information about the use of the Service (the aforementioned anonymous activity log data), device
                    type (e.g., iPad Air), browser, operating system (e.g., iOS8.1), and country. We use this information to administer and improve the user's experience on our Service, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions,
                    and to gather broad demographic information. We use Google Analytics to collect and aggregate this information. We generate a custom user ID in Google Analytics to ensure that a user cannot be tracked across devices, apps, or sites.
                    We do not allow any third-party advertising services or tracking technologies on the Service. We do not allow a child or student's personal information to be tracked and used to target advertisements on other third-party websites or
                    services. We do not allow any third party to use a child or student's data to create a profile, engage in data enhancement or social advertising, or targeted advertising.

                </h3>
                <p class="privacyParagraph">
                    We may share aggregated Non-Personal Information generated by use of the Service – including data collected via Google Analytics — with vendors contracted by the Social Media Lab to maintain the Service funders, partners, financial supporters and sponsors
                    of the Service or the Social Media Lab for various reasons, such as understanding how to increase the effectiveness of the Social Media Labs's services and the traffic and trends occurring on the Social Media TestDrive Service. In
                    addition, we may share aggregated Non-Personal Information with academic or other researchers and with the news media. We do not share any data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. We do not sell or rent out users’
                    personal information. We do not display any behavioral or contextual advertising based on users’ personal information. We do not display any advertising on the Service. The data collected through anonymous user log and Qualtrics feedback
                    surveys will be used to improve the Service.

                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any information generated through use of the Service to others, consistent with applicable law and as we believe to be appropriate (a) under applicable

                    No website is completely secure or "hacker proof." As such, we cannot promise that a third party will be unable to use the Service for unauthorized purposes, such as attempting to access information stored on a device on which the App is installed. If
                    you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the section below entitled "Contacting Us." Please note that, if you notify
                    us by physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.
